/*
        Everything within this package is WIP
        Most of it works for my usecase fine, may not work in other applications correctly
            f.e. my beat saber stuff does not work always, sometimes the blocks fire off events prior to getting down lane
            or they simply don't display correctly as in wrong block. Unsure why this is
        As for the video > Image > Animation in unity project
            everything works wonderfully provided you know the exact fps and how many frames you would like to display per second
                if not at original fps
