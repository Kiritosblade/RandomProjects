this project will take a beatsaber song.dat file as input, convert it to exported song.txt,
then take that input and use it for creating animation files in unity.
in this case it's meant to be used with my beat saber setup in unity but this same program can be used
    in any sort of animations, for example using the song for crabrave in beat saber i've used this program to generate
    screen space shader param animations at on/off events with timing along to the beat of the song for videos/music/etc
