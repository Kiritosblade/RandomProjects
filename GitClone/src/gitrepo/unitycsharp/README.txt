This package is just imported as copy from my unity project.
the purpose of this is to take a beat saber song file and turn the song into data
that i can then read into unity animations to then animate my 'beat saber' which i've setup in unity project.
This allows me to use beat saber songs in vrchat as animations due to the blocks being particles
and controlled using an animation to change isActive && positions/rotation of the block.
